# Plan for 2022

## Introduction

Exercism exists to help people become great programmers - to develop solid fluency in multiple programming languages, and to do so in a way that does not discrimate based on someone's personal situation.

In 2020-21 we rewrote Exercism to solve various fundamental issues with the platform.
At the heart of those changes was making mentoring more substainable, through a mixture of automation, removing automatic requests and blocking, and adding automation.
We also added a signifcant base of community-features centred around the earning of Reputation.
These have now given us the basis to create "rep-gates" parts of Exercism's experience, where our more senior, trusted community members can have more responsibility, allowing us to hand over more trust to our community.

Now we have built a great base, we need to build on it.
There are four main areas that we want to expand on during 2022:
1. Developing our community
2. Developing our content
3. Encouraging and supporting mentoring
4. Building out our Dojo platform

Alongside and underpinning all of these is the need to build and substain momentum throughout the year.
As a platform we constantly add new features and content, which should be constantly bringing people back to the site, but do an awful job at telling people about it.
We also "recruit" a huge amount of volunteers, but fail to nurture most of them into longer term contributors.
A substained focus on building momentum will help with both of these issues.

### Quantitive Objectives

The overarching objective of 2022 is to consolodate the work that we have achieved with the creation of v3 and grow Exercism's community, content and usage in a substainable way.
The key usage metrics, which we believe measure how well we achieve our mission, and which we want to impact during 2022 are:

- **Total Users:** Grow to 5m users (currently 750k). This would be 10x the daily signups we currently have.
- **Initial Usage:** 75% of all users signing up should submit something (currently 50%).
- **One-week Retention:** 33% of users that sign up should submit something after the week in which they sign up (currently 9.4%).
- **One-month Retention:** 15% of users that sign up should submit something after the month in which they sign up (currently 3.6%).
- **Mentoring Requests:** 25% of all Practice Solutions are sent for mentoring (currently 8.3%).
  i.e. ensure that mentoring is enticing and attractive.
- **Mentoring Given:** 99% of Mentoring Requests are responded to within 3 days (currently ~99%).
- **Mentoring Quality:** 98% of completed Mentoring Discussioins get positive reviews (currently 93%) and <0.01% are negative (currently 1.2%)

Achieving these goals involves a variety of improvements to the platform, growth of the community (quantity and quality), marketing/promotion, and improvements to the content itself.
At the heart of achieving these is hiring a great team.
Therefore, in addition to our metrics-based goals, the key business goal of 2022 is hiring the right people and making Exercism a great place to work.
We aim to hire the following roles during 2022:

- Fundraiser
- Community Builder/Manager
- Content/Education Person
- Backend Developer (Rails)
- Frontend Developer (React + CSS)

That will leave us with a team of 7 people, which will cost ~£400k/year.
This means at the heart of everything is raising funds in a long-term, substainable way.
We therefore have a fundraising target of £500k, of which we hope 20% (£100k) can come from the community, and £400k from industry.
For context, we have raised £340k in **unsolicited** donations over the last 3 years, and currently have £150k in the bank, enough to fund Erik, the fundraiser, and one other member of staff.

### Platform Improvements

At the heart of Exercism is its platform.
During 2020-2021 we rebuilt Exercism's platform from scratch to solve some of the fundamental issues in it.
The new platform has been a great success, but there is still lots that is unfinished and not yet implemented.

For 2022, our key priorities are:
- Adding Representation authoring for mentors
- Building out better dashboards and controls for maintainers
- Add better action/reaction emails (inc switching to SES for cost reduction)
- Adding Approaches and populating them.
- Improving discoverability (e.g. searching community solutions)
- Handling errors better (e.g. replaying test-runs)
- Making the platform fully responsive
- Adding dark theme

## Building our Community

Our community is both our key USP and our most powerful resource for both developing and marketing Exercism.
However, currently we do very little to grow and nurture that community.
Without a dedicated person, we do not have the time to put into developing the community, and we do not have the right tools or platform for that platform to grow organically.

We currently have three parts to our community:
1. Our "inner circle" of maintainers, key mentors, etc.
  The people that come on weekly calls and help guide direction.
2. Our wider circle of mentors and contributors who don't interact directly with us, but make up part of Exercism's team.
3. Our users, who are using Exercism to learn, interacting with each others solutions and mentor's advice, opening issues on GH, tweeting, etc.

A key goal for 2022 is to bring these people together into a wider community, with a shared sense of belonging.
Achieving this means us leaving Slack, which is too walled off, and integrating forums/discussions directly into Exercism.
In doing this we aim to move people from 3->2 and from 2->1, increasing our groups of regular and key contributors.

There's lots to think through and many potential pitfalls in this, but achieving this will be the difference between us being a niche site sitting alongside larger VC-funded platforms, and us being the go-to place to develop your programming skills in a safe, fun, useful environment.

Our Community Manager hire will be responsible for building and nurturing this community.

## Content

We currently have a spectrum of tracks ranging from those with well-considered syllabuses, interesting exercises, and excellent analyzers on one side, to those with a handful of Practice Exercises on the other.
While this spectrum is a natural consequence of having content be community-led, it also makes the experience very uncertain for a student, who might use Exercism initially to learn a language without Concepts, and not realise that other tracks are so much better.

In 2022, we have three content objectives:
1. Support the tracks at the good-end of the spectrum to cement their quality and continue to grow, and find a way to highlight them within Exercism.
2. To ensure that tracks at the bad-end of the spectrum are "good-enough".
3. Develop cross-track content that benefits all languages (e.g. creating a great resource on Recursion that all tracks can refer to and build on).

Our Content Manager hire will be responsible for supporting both experienced and new maintainers and creating resources that would be valuable to them.

## Appendix 1: Assorted Notes

### Notes on extension platforms

We have discussed three attached platforms as possible developments during 2022:
1. Exercism Teams - where people can chat together in solving exercises and mentoring each other in private spaces.
2. A "learn to code" version of Exercism
3. A platform (or platforms) for learning technologies away from programming languages (e.g. React or a11y).

We intend to build out a minimal version of (1) during H1 2022.
We don't want to compete with other collaberative coding platforms (e.g. Replit's Teams) so the key is finding the space where Exercism is specifically useful for groups of people.
We will design this by surveying those who have already used Exercism teams in previous versions of the platform.

(2) is an important part of Exercism's medium-term vision.
If we were to do it during 2022, it would require a specific team to build out and that would need to be funded by a partner.
So our decision to do that would largely depend on those variables.

Finally, (3) is something that we get asked for reguarly and could fit into Exercism's long-term vision, but is unlikely to be something we approach during 2022.
Let's get the core Exercism really right first.
